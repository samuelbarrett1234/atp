Search Settings File Format</h1>
<p>Search settings allow the user to choose a solver, and parameters for that solver, and save them into a persistent configuration file. The format is quite simple; there are some parameters which do not depend on the solver type, and some parameters depend on the type of solver.</p>
<p>The following settings are universal (independent of solver type): </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Your settings type name here&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;desc&quot; : &quot;Your settings type description here&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;step-size&quot; : 1000,</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;max-steps&quot; : 10,</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;seed&quot; : &quot;time&quot;</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p><code>step-size</code> is the number of expansions to perform (on each target proof) at each iteration. <code>max-steps</code> is the maximum number of updates to perform, although the target statements may be proven earlier than this.</p>
<p><code>seed</code> is the seed value used for a random number generator. You can either set this equal to the string <code>"time"</code>, which seeds it based on the current clock time when the program is launched, or you can give it a fixed integer value for reproducability. Any other string value is an error.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Solvers</h1>
<p>Solvers support a set of flags which governs how the proof states iterate over their successors. These are represented by the <code>no-repeats</code> and <code>randomised</code> flags. When <code>no-repeats</code> is true, the proof states don't allow successors which have already been seen, where this is possible to implement reasonably. There is of course a tradeoff here, in that this test demands extra checks for each successor, but there will be fewer of them. When <code>randomised</code> is true, the successors are enumerated in an order which is as random as is reasonably possible. This is useful for statistical estimation, which might assume the successors are IID, however this might negatively impact cache behaviour.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Iterative Deepening Solver</h2>
<p>The iterative deepening solver is specified using the <code>IterativeDeepeningSolver</code> type, and has several parameters which govern the depth to which it searches to, amongst other things. Here is a (partial) example of an iterative deepening solver settings file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Search settings with an Iterative-Deepening Solver&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;solver&quot; : {</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;IterativeDeepeningSolver&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;max-depth&quot; : 5,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;starting-depth&quot; : 3,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;width-limit&quot; : 50,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;width-limit-start-depth&quot; : 2,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;no-repeats&quot; : true,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;randomised&quot; : true</div>
<div class="line">    },</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>In order to create an iterative deepening solver, you must use the type <code>IterativeDeepeningSolver</code>. The new parameters are <code>max-depth</code>, <code>start-depth</code>, <code>width-limit</code>, and <code>width-limit-start-depth</code>. <code>max-depth</code> is the ultimate depth limit imposed on the iterative deepening search, and <code>start-depth</code> is the first depth limit. <code>width-limit</code> keeps a limit on the branching factor, to reduce exponential blowup a bit. However, this width limit only applies at a particular depth and beyond - <code>width-limit-start-depth</code> is a nonnegative integer representing the lowest depth level where the width limit is put in place. If this were zero, it means it always applies. Note that if the width is not limited, it is likely that the solver will only explore one branch at the root, unless it is left running for ages.</p>
<p>Setting the start depth higher means less wasted work for long proofs, but it makes finding short proofs much less efficient than they otherwise would be. Tighter width limits means you will be able to explore proofs of greater depth, but any limit on the width is cutting into the search space (by just outright not exploring possibilities), so only use a tight width limit when the solver also has heuristics available to pick the best branches.</p>
<p>Iterative deepening search will make use of any successor modifiers (e.g. stopping strategies) that are specified in the settings file (see below).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Selection Strategies</h1>
<p>Selection strategies govern how the ATP loads in theorems from the database to try to prove a given set of statements. Of course, it is infeasible to load <em>all</em> proven theorems, because (i) there might be too many to fit in memory, and (ii) it would increase the branching factor too much. If you like, these strategies select lemmas for the target theorem.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
Fixed Selection Strategy</h2>
<p>The fixed selection strategy just loads a prescribed number of theorems from the database at random. The higher this number is, the higher the branching factor, but the more it leverages existing knowledge. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Search settings with a fixed selection strategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;selection-strategy&quot; : {</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;FixedSelectionStrategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;num-helper-thms&quot; : 10</div>
<div class="line">    },</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
Edit Distance Selection Strategy</h2>
<p>The edit distance selection strategy is a bit more sophisticated than the fixed selection strategy. It starts by loading a large number of theorems from the database (again, at random, identically to the above), and then computes the pairwise edit distance between each statement loaded, and each target theorem. It picks a subset of that loaded set of helper theorems to be carried forward to help in the proof.</p>
<p>This strategy has four parameters: <code>num-thms-load</code> is the number of theorems to load from the database, identically to <code>num-helper-theorems</code> in the fixed selection strategy. <code>num-thms-help</code> is the size of the subset of theorems to select, and carry forward to the proof. The higher this number is, the higher the branching factor, but the more it leverages existing knowledge. <code>symbol-mismatch-cost</code> and <code>symbol-match-benefit</code> are parameters for the edit distance computation, which proceeds as follows. The cost of a free variable substitution is always fixed at <code>1.0</code>, but the cost of a mismatch between symbols is exactly <code>symbol-mismatch-cost</code>, and the <em>benefit</em> (decrease in cost) of two symbols matching is <code>symbol-match-benefit</code>. Think of these two values as being in direct opposition (they are the same "scale", both relative to the cost of a free variable substitution, which as mentioned is 1). It is hard to say what values of this would be good (except that such values should be <code>&gt; 0.0</code>), so experimentation is needed!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
Heuristics</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
Edit Distance Heuristic</h2>
<p>This heuristic computes (a variant of) the edit distance between the target and the current position, to hopefully guide the search to arrive at the right path more quickly. In equational logic, this is done by computing the edit distance between the "forefront" statement, and each of the axioms (and loaded helper theorems), and then returning the utility as a function of these distances.</p>
<p>The two edit distance parameters of this heuristic are the same as <code>ed-symbol-match-benefit</code> and <code>ed-symbol-mismatch-cost</code> as explained above.</p>
<p>Here is an example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Solver with an edit distance heuristic&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;heuristic&quot; : {</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;EditDistanceHeuristic&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;symbol-match-benefit&quot; : 3.0,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;symbol-mismatch-cost&quot; : 5.0</div>
<div class="line">    },</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Stopping Strategies</h1>
<p>Stopping strategies are a class of statistical strategies for using a heuristic function to enumerate through successors. This is useful because there may be a great many successors to a given statement, and it is costly to even generate them all. Hence we may want to generate a few at a time and pick the best.</p>
<p>Stopping strategies only affect the order in which successors are enumerated, and not the results of the iterators. A stopping strategy cannot be successful without a good heuristic, first and foremost.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Fixed Stopping Strategy</h2>
<p>This is a very elementary stopping strategy. It always keeps <code>N</code> successors in memory at a time, and returns the best one. When it advances, it removes the best one from the list, and obtains the next successor. When there are no successors left, it enumerates the <code>N</code> elements in memory in nonincreasing order.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to specify it in a search settings file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Solver with a Fixed Stopping Strategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;stopping-strategy&quot; : {</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;FixedStoppingStrategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;size&quot; : 5</div>
<div class="line">    },</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
Basic Stopping Strategy</h2>
<p>This stopping strategy is statistical in nature. It models the <em>cost</em> and <em>benefit</em> of each successor as the time it took to compute, and the heuristic value, respectively. It approximates these values with a normal distribution (estimating the parameters from the data seen so far), and computes the probability that one more evaluation would result in a better benefit for a small increase in cost.</p>
<p>More precisely, if <code>X</code> is a normally-distributed random variable representing the cost, <code>Y</code> is a normally-distributed random variable representing the benefit heuristic, <code>s</code> is the sum of the costs of the states held in memory so far, and <code>m</code> is the maximum benefit held in the states in memory at the moment, then we choose to stop evaluating successors when:</p>
<p><code>P ( lambda * (Y - m) &gt; X + s ) &lt; alpha</code></p>
<p>For parameters <code>lambda &gt; 0</code> and <code>alpha \in (0,1)</code>.</p>
<p>Note that, in order to help gather data to estimate the distributions in the early moments of the successor enumeration, this stopping strategy inputs an integer <code>initial-size</code> and it starts by adding in this many successors, regardless to their cost/benefit values. This helps get reliable estimates for the distribution parameters first.</p>
<p>Finally, note that since this is a statistical-based strategy, it will assume the successors are IID, hence it is better to use <code>randomised = true</code> whenever this stopping strategy is used.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to specify it in a search settings file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Solver with a Fixed Stopping Strategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;stopping-strategy&quot; : {</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;BasicStoppingStrategy&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;initial-size&quot; : 10,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;lambda&quot; : 10.0,</div>
<div class="line">        &quot;alpha&quot; : 0.05</div>
<div class="line">    },</div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
