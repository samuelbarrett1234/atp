Type theory:

Element (can query Arity)
UniverseElement : Element (Arity 1)
TupleElementN : Element (Arity >1)
Set (of Elements with fixed Arity)

Tuples are ALWAYS unpacked, e.g. if x \in S then S implicitly always has elements of arity 1 and contains no tuples.

Syntactic sugar help for relations and functions, but they are still just sets
Sugar: R(x1, .., xn) ... (x1, .., xn) \in R
       f(x1, .., xn) = y ... (x1, .., xn, y) \in f
